- When we write something using Hardware Description Language, we are describing **HARDWARE & CIRCUITS** instead of **PROGRAMS & FUNCTIONS**.

- Before starting to write a program using SpinalHDL, we need to have a picture of the circuit that we want to implement.

- In hardware, every wire, gate, and register is running in every cycle. Everything happens simultaneously.

- common errors: https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Design%20errors/index.html

# Basic Concepts

- module (Component in SpinalHDL)
- wire
- gate
- register

## Module / Component

- a basic piece of hardware that has input wires and output wires
- every hardware component (wire/gate/register) must belong to some Module

## Wire

- wires are bundles of bits
- every wire has input and output

- in spinalhdl, wires have types, which specify the bit width of the wires and operands on the wires. 
- to create a wire of 10-bit `UInt`
```scala
val w = UInt(10 bits)
```
- we should consider `w` as a reference to a hardware wire with hardware type `UInt(10 bits)`, instead of a scala variable that contains some integer value.
- spinalhdl hardware types are not scala types but scala terms 
- scala does not support "10 bits" in types, so `UInt(10 bits)` is just an instance of scala class `UInt`.

- some wires are used as the input/output interface of a module
- to declare a wire as an input
```scala
val w = UInt(10 bits)
in(w)
```

or in one line
```scala
val w = in(UInt(10 bits))
```

other equivalent syntax sugars
```scala
val w = in UInt(10 bits)
val w = in port UInt(10 bits)
```

- to declare a wire as an output
```scala
val w = UInt(10 bits)
out(w)
```

- except the input of the current module, every wire must be input by hardware assignment. common hardware assignments include
  - `:=`
  ```scala
  val w = UInt(10 bits)
  w := U(512, 10 bits)
  ```
  Here, `U(512, 10bits)` is a hardware value that can be assigned to the input of some wire
  - `assignFromBits`
  ```scala
  val bs = Bits(10 bits)
  bs := B("0101010101")
  val w = UInt(10 bits)
  w.assignFromBits(bs)
  ```
  use `assignFromBits` when we don't want type checking.

- except the output of the current module, every wire must be output to somewhere (or it is unused).

- we can group several wires as a new type of wire using `Bundle`
```scala
case class Point3(n: Int) extends Bundle {
    val x = SInt(n bits)
    val y = SInt(n bits)
    val z = SInt(n bits)
}

val p1 = Point3(10)
val p2 = Point3(10)
p2 := p1
```

- we can get an "array" of wires
```scala
val ws = Vec.fill(16)(UInt(10 bits))
```
`ws(i)` is a `UInt(10 bits)` for 0<=i<=15.

- we can take a slice of a multi-bit wire
```scala
val w = UInt(10 bits)
val bs = Bits(3 bits)
bs := w(9 downto 7)
// bs := w(7, 3 bits)
// bs(0) := w(7)
// bs(1) := w(8)
// bs(2) := w(9)
```
`bs` is assigned by the 3 most significant bits of `w`

- typecasting: for some predefined hardware types, there are some default type casting
```scala
val bs = Bits(10 bits)
bs := B("0101010101")
val w = UInt(10 bits)
w := bs.asUInt
```

- `cloneOf` makes a wire of the same type
```scala
val w = UInt(10 bits)
// val u = UInt(10 bits)
val u = cloneOf(w)
```

- `HardType` creates a "factory" of some type
```scala
// dataType is not a wire, but a function that creates wire with type UInt(10 bits)
val dataType = HardType(UInt(10 bits))
// val w = UInt(10 bits)
val w = dataType()
// val u = UInt(10 bits)
val u = dataType()
```

- hardware literals/constants
  - `U(7, 8 bits)`: a `UInt(8 bits)` with value `7`
  - `S(-7, 8 bits)`: a `SInt(8 bits)` with value `-7`
  - `B("01010101")`: a `Bits(8 bits)` with value `01010101`
  - `True`, `False`: `Bool` constants

- assignment in simulation
  - in simulation, we can assign the input of a module using `#=`
  ```scala
  dut.i #= true
  ```
  - `#=` takes `1` unit time to effect. so we need `sleep(1)` after `#=`
  - the right hand side of `#=` is scala value instead of hardware constants
    - use `dut.i #= 7` instead of `dut.i #= U(7, 8 bits)`
    - use `dut.i #= true` instead of `dut.i #= True`

## Gate

- gates are boolean functions / combinational circuit
- different types of wires have different gates
  - [Bits](https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Data%20types/bits.html)
    - `===`: the equivalence of hardware types uses triple `=`
    - `~`: bitwise not
    - `|`: bitwise or
    - `&`: bitwise and
    - ...
  - [UInt/SInt](https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Data%20types/Int.html)
    - `===`
    - `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
    - `+`, `-`, `*`
    - ...

- multiplexer: `when`
```scala
val b = in(Bool())
val x = UInt(10 bits)
val y = UInt(10 bits)
val w = UInt(10 bits)
w := x + y // default value of w is 512
when(b) {
    w := x - y // when b is true, w is assigned 256
}
```
this should be understood as `w` is assigned by the output of a multiplexer controlled by `b`, instead of one branch and two assignment to `w` in common programming languages. every wire has exactly one input signal

- `Vec` can be indexed by `UInt`
```scala
val ws = Vec.fill(16)(UInt(10 bits))
val w = UInt(10 bits)
val idx = UInt(4 bits)
w := ws(idx)
```
this is implemented by multiplexer

- `Vec` vs `List`
  - `Vec` is hardware type defined in spinalhdl, which can be indexed by `UInt`
  - `List` is a scala type, which can not be indexed by hardware index
  ```scala
  val ws = List.fill(16)(UInt(10 bits))
  val w = UInt(10 bits)
  val idx = UInt(4 bits)
  w := ws(5) // ok
  w := ws(idx) // fail
  ```
  - `List` can be used to create a list of modules, `Vec` can only be used for wires
  ```scala
  val ms = List.fill(16)(SomeModules()) // ok
  val ms = Vec.fill(16)(SomeModules()) // fail
  ```


- in an ideal model, the outputs of a gate change instantly after the inputs change

## Register

- registers are used to store states / implement sequential circuits
- to create a register of some type, use `Reg(type)`
```scala
val r = Reg(UInt(10 bits))
```
- to create a register of the same type of some wire, use `Reg(wire)`
```scala
val w = Reg(UInt(10 bits))
val r = Reg(w) // r is a register of type UInt(10 bits)
```
- the state of a register is updated to the input at the positive edge of the clock signal
- the output of a register is the state of the register
```scala
val i = in(UInt(10 bits))
val o = out(UInt(10 bits))
val r = Reg(UInt(10 bits))
r := i
o := r
```

- registers can be updated conditionally
```scala
val i = in(UInt(10 bits))
val o = out(UInt(10 bits))
val en = in(Bool())
val r = Reg(UInt(10 bits))
when(en) {
  r := i
}
o := r
```
`r` is updated only when `en` is true


- in practice, gates take some time to output the result. 
  - the deeper a combinational circuit is, the longer it takes to output the result. 
  - when the clock frequency is 500Mhz, where each cycle is 2ns, even 2 addition gates in sequence are infeasible.
  - we can break computation into multiple steps using register

## exercise1:
- write a pipeline accumulator
- width and input number are parameterized

## exercise2:
- write a complex number multiplication module
- on each stage, only multiplication and addition with depth 1 can be applied
